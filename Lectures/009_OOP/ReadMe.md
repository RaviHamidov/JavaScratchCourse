# ðŸ“˜ OOP Documentation

> In this document i need to touch & repeat all oop concepts

## 1. Introduction to OOP

- What is Object-Oriented Programming?

  > oop is a programming paradigm which is based on concepts of "Objects", which are instances of `classes`, allows you to structure your code like real-world models and i want to mention 4 main principles of oop: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction

- Benefits of OOP

  > Modularity, Reusability, Scalability, Maintainability, Encapsulation, RealWorld modeling, Polymorphisim

- Real-life analogy

  > To understand OOP better, let's look at a real-world example â€” a Car, For example: Imagine a "Car": You can think of Car as a class, Each specific car you see (Toyota, BMW, etc.) is an object created from that class.

## 2. Core Concepts of OOP

- ðŸ”¹ Class

  - Blueprint for creating objects

    > Blueprint is just a plan or template

  - Contains fields (variables) and methods (functions)

- ðŸ”¹ Object

  - Instance of a class

    > it's just a plan, and object is a something created with class's plan

  - Represents a real-world entity

- ðŸ”¹ Encapsulation

  > in simplfy think it is just pharmacy capsul encapsulated from the other things, and like this rule in program some data named like `private` so that they cannot be changed from anywhere

  - Binding data and methods together
  - Access modifiers: private, public, protected

    > private: can only be accessed from within the same class, public: can be accessed from anywhere, protected: can be accessed from the same package and subclasses

  - Getters and Setters

    > in these methods we can read private datas

    ```Java
    public class Student {
        private String name;

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }

        public void setName(String newName) {
            name = newName;
        }
    }
    ```

- ðŸ”¹ Abstraction

  - Hiding complex implementation details
  - Exposing only essential features
  - Abstract classes and Interfaces

- ðŸ”¹ Inheritance

  - Acquiring properties and behaviors from another class
  - `extends` keyword
    > this keyword help us to extend parent class's behaviors
  - Superclass (parent) & Subclass (child)

  ```Java
    class Animal {
        void eat() {
            System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
        }
    }

    class Dog extends Animal {
        void bark() {
            System.out.println("The dog barks.");
        }
    }

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Dog myDog = new Dog();
            myDog.eat();  // Inherited from Animal
            myDog.bark(); // Defined in Dog
        }
    }
  ```

- ðŸ”¹ Polymorphism

  > It means **"many forms"** â€” that is, the ability to use the same method in different ways.

  - Many forms: method overloading & overriding

    - Method overloading

      > Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parametrs in the same class and this known as compile time polymorphism

      ```Java
      class Math {
            int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
            }

            int add(int a, int b, int c) {
            return a + b + c;
            }
        }

      ```

    - Method overriding
      > A subclass redefines a method defined in the superclass according to its own needs and it's known as runtime polymorphism

    ```Java
    class Animal {
        void makeSound() {
            System.out.println("Animal makes a sound.");
        }
    }

    class Cat extends Animal {
        void makeSound() {
            System.out.println("Cat meows.");
        }
    }
    ```

## 3. Advanced OOP Concepts

- Constructor and Overloaded Constructor

- Constructor

  > it's a special methhod that is automaticly called when an object is created, it has name **same name as the class** and **does not have a return type** and it used to **initialize objects** with the default or initial values

  ```Java
  class Person {
  String name;
      // Constructor
      Person() {
          name = "Unknown";
      }
  }
  ```

- Overloaded Constructor

  > Means that having more than one contructor in the same class with different parametrs, it allows objects to be initialized in multiple ways

  ```Java
    class Person {
        String name;
        int age;

        // Default constructor
        Person() {
            name = "Unknown";
            age = 0;
        }

        // Overloaded constructor
        Person(String name, int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

    }

  ```

- this and super keywords

  - `this` keyword

    > refers to current object of class, it used also when you want to **Distinguish** between **class fields** and **method parameters** that have same name, can also be used to **call another constructor** in the same class

    ```Java
    class Student {
        String name;

        Student(String name) {
            this.name = name; // 'this.name' refers to the class variable
        }
    }
    ```

    ```Java
    class Student {
        String name;
        int age;

        Student() {
            this("Unknown", 0); // Calls the constructor below
        }

        Student(String name, int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
    }

    ```

- Static members
- Final keyword
- Composition vs Inheritance
- Aggregation

## 4. Access Modifiers

- public, private, protected, and default
- How they affect visibility

## 5. Interface vs Abstract Class

- Differences and use cases
- When to use which?

## 6. Real-world OOP Example

- Mini project or code snippet demonstrating OOP in action

## 7. OOP Best Practices

- SOLID Principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, etc.)
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Reusability
- Maintainability
